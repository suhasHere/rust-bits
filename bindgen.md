The bindings.rs file is generated by bindgen in your build.rs script. Let me show you:


  1. Input: The C header file ffi/include/quicr_ffi.h (line 279)
  2. Bindgen configuration (lines 278-287):
  bindgen::Builder::default()
      .header("ffi/include/quicr_ffi.h")
      .allowlist_function("quicr_.*")    // Only include functions starting with "quicr_"
      .allowlist_type("Quicr.*")         // Only include types starting with "Quicr"
      .allowlist_var("QUICR_.*")         // Only include vars starting with "QUICR_"
      .derive_debug(true)
      .derive_default(true)
      .derive_eq(true)
      .derive_hash(true)
  3. Output: Written to $OUT_DIR/bindings.rs (line 314)
  bindings.write_to_file(out_dir.join("bindings.rs"))

  Where bindings.rs lives

  The file is generated at build time into Cargo's OUT_DIR, which is typically:
  target/debug/build/quicr-<hash>/out/bindings.rs

  The warnings you saw earlier reference this path:
  target/debug/build/quicr-eec8f243fcaacdbd/out/bindings.rs

  How it's included in the crate

  Somewhere in your src/ (likely src/ffi.rs or src/lib.rs), there should be:
  include!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/bindings.rs"));

  This includes the generated bindings at compile time.
